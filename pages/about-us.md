### What do we do

__Yunism Technology__ is a small team that delivers tailor-made web solutions.

___
### What do we use

The basic technology stack used are `LEMP` :
 - Linux
 - Nginx
 - MySQL (MariaDB)
 - PHP

On top of that, we actually use [Laravel](laravel-homepage), a powerful php 
MVC framework. It provides a few tools that make development so much easier, 
and yeah, we are living on that.

We are also looking into [Vue.js](vuejs-homepage) as our front-end framework, 
it makes flashy and snappy web UX easier.

___
### How we work (...ideally)

We are a software house, following typical SDLC - the waterfall model ([if it 
exists][a-good-post-found-on-hacker-news]). Typically, the workflows (that 
visible to clients) are as following :

- Conceptualisation
- Scoping
- Specification Writing
- Wireframe / Mockup
- Backend Integration
- UAT
- Review and the-Loop

___
### Who we need

- Someone that can draw Software Engineering diagrams out of something.
- Someone that can write that thick documentation out of nothing.
- Someone that can code and stay happy.
- Someone that can design for modern web.
- Someone that just enjoy creating value in this industry.

___
### Where we are

```
